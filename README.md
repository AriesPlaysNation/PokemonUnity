Pokémon Unity was in development for about a year before I could not continue working on the project. Rather than let it
die, I released the source as is.

I have changed a lot of code that was either unused (most unused assets were removed) or were obsolete. There can be a lot of conflicts if you're looking forward to using this branch as a framework rather than the master branch. Please be aware that some features in this branch are incomplete.

I strongly recommend that you use the master branch as a base rather than the develop branch. This branch is entirely experimental and has the possibility of breaking your fangame or other project.

## Demo and Downloads

There is a demo WebGL for testing available here: [Link to Unity Cloud Build](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/Wy-y2uSUhG/)
